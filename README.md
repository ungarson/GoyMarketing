# HERE I EXPLAIN HOW TO MAKE CHANGES!

Do you have experience with programming? If so, then you may run the Next.js project locally. Proceed to the "Getting started".

If you don't have experience with programming, then proceed to "Make changes to the database".

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Make changes to the database

Open the data folder in this project, then proceed to the database.json. Hopefully, you know how the JSON works.
After applying changes to the database.json, create a pull request on github.
